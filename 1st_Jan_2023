128. Longest Consecutive Sequence---

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

-------------------------solution-------

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        numSet=set(nums) # number ko set me liya 
        longest=0 # longest ko 0 iniatialize kiya
        for n in nums: 
            if (n-1) not in numSet: # agar nums me left number nahi hai to length 0 
                length=0
                while(n+length) in numSet: # nums ka inside element  (n +length)  agar set m ho to length increase kar diya 
                    length+=1
                longest= max(length,longest)# maximum value liya
        return longest
